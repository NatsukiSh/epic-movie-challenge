          <p>
            When "Porco" - whose face has been transformed into that of a pig by
            a mysterious spell - infuriates a band of sky pirates with his
            aerial heroics, the pirates hire Curtis, a comical rival pilot, to
            "get rid" of him. On the ground, the two pilots compete over the
            affections of Gina, a beautiful cabaret singer. But it is in the
            air, with Fio, a young and talented airplane engineer/designer,
            where Porco's true battles are waged. From its Mediterranean Sea
            settings to its dazzling aerial dogfights of amazing sweep and
            grace, PORCO ROSSO is an exhilarating ride you'll never forget.
